# What are these?
These files are all design rule files for use with Eagle PCB software. They tell Eagle what things to flag as warning and errors when you run a design rule check (DRC).

More specifically, they are design rules for PCBs that are destined to be manufactured by a hobbyist on a PCB mill or another form of "at-home" manufacturing. As such, they impose greater restrictions on the minimum sizes for things like traces, vias, drill holes, and clearances so as to maximize the possibility that the PCBs can be successfully fabricated.

"Hobby_by-westfw" is a design rule file taken from the [Instructable page by westfw](https://www.instructables.com/id/Make-hobbyist-PCBs-with-professional-CAD-tools-by-/). That Instructable also has some excellent explnations of the various design rules and also shows the author's fabrication experiment.

The files that start "Othermill" were taken from an [instructional page by Bantam Tools](https://support.bantamtools.com/hc/en-us/articles/115001656793-EAGLE) about using a PCB mill for fabrication. There is also a lot of good information here. The Bantam Tools software is also freely available for download (Windows only), which you can use to see what kind of tools and time it would take to mill your PCB using one of their mills.
